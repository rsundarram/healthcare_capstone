ANALYZED PATIENT DATA TO IDENTIFY RISK FACTORES FOR HEART ATTACKS.
•	Preliminary analysis:
1.	Perform preliminary data inspection and report the findings as to the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.
2.	Based on the findings from the previous question remove duplicates (if any), treat missing values using an appropriate strategy.

•	   Prepare an informative report about the data explaining the distribution of the disease and the related factors. You could use the below approach to achieve the objective.
1.	 Get the preliminary statistical summary of the data. Explore the measures       of central tendencies and spread of the data overall.
2.	 Identify the data variables which might be categorical in nature. Describe and explore these variables using appropriate tools. E.g. count plot.
3.	 Analyze distribution of age in range of 10
4.	 Can we detect a heart attack based on anomalies in the resting blood pressure of the patient? 
5.	 Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and our target variables.
6.	 Is thalassemia is major cause of CVD.

•	  Build a baseline model to predict using a Logistic Regression and explore the results.
